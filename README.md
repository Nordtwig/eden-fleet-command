# eden-fleet-command
A topdown, 2D tactical space battle simulator. Where you pit your fleet commander and their, hopefully, properly composed fleet against another. Positioning, synergy and playing to your strengths and the enemies weaknesses will be paramount to victory. Inspired by my favorite Icelandic space sim, but legally distinct for the sake of my sanity.
